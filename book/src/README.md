# Introduction

`twitch-tui` is a Terminal User Interface for reading and interacting with Twitch chat users.

The ideal setup would be this application and [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink), to obliterate all need for a browser while watching streams.

This book is still under construction, so some sections might still be missing. Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Xithrius/twitch-tui/issues/new/choose) if you find that something needs improvement.

## Quick start

This application has vim and emacs inspired keybinds. That means you will start out in visual mode.

To enter insert mode, press `i`. To drop back to visual mode, press `esc`.

Insert modes at this time are message search (`Ctrl + f`), channel swapper (`s`), and the previously mentioned insert mode (`i`).

To see all the options with keybinds, either head over to the [keybinds section](https://xithrius.github.io/twitch-tui/keybinds/index.html) of this book, or press `?` while in visual mode.
